Gospel is a prototype-based, object-oriented programming language with special support for concurrency. This interpreter for it is being distributed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License: See the "LICENSE" file in the root directory for details.

At the moment it is still missing some planned core features, and generally isn't yet capable of doing any real work. This first release is intended mainly as proof that, after months of talk, some part of Gospel does in fact exist outside of the author's head. The "MANUAL" file contains a brief introduction: "canon.gs" (the core library), "repl.gs" (implementing the interpreter's interactive mode) and "lib/inquisition.gs" (the first stab at an xUnit implementation) can be looked to for examples.

Running "make" in the root directory will build the interpreter, a file called "gospel". If gospel is run with a command-line argument it will execute that file. If not, it will present the REPL.
